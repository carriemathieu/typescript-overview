### Type Annotations
- Code we add to tell Typescript what type of value a variable will refer to
    - When to use?
        - When we declare a variable on one line then initialize later
        - When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
        - When a function returns the "any" type and we need to clarify the value
### Type Inference
- Typescript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to
    - When to use? Always!
